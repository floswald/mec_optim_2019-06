    "In this block, we shall take a first look at marriage data (while a worker-firm example will be seen in next block). Dupuy and Galichon (JPE, 2014) study a marriage dataset where, in addition to usual socio-demographic variables (such as education and age), measures of personality traits are reported.\n",

    "* In addition to this, we observed a (self-assessed) measure of health, risk-aversion, education, height and body mass index = weight in kg/ (height in m)$^2$. In total, the available characteristics $x_{i}$ of man $i$ and $y_{j}$ of woman $j$ are both $10$-dimensional vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is assumed that the surplus of interaction is given by $\\Phi\\left(x_{i},y_{j}\\right)  =x_{i}^{\\intercal}Ay_{j}$, where $A$ is a *given* $10 \\times 10$ matrix. (later in this course, we'll see how to estimate $A$ based on matched marital data).\n",
